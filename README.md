# New York City Current Job Postings Exploration
This project uses Apache Spark to explore the popular New York City Current Job Postings [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/new-york-city-current-job-postings).

[Apache Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/) notebooks are used to work interactively with the data, please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/JohnnyFoulds/nyc-job-exploration/wiki) for details of how a development environment was configured for use in this project.
