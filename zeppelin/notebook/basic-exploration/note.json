A major initiative of the MHIL is the Connection to Care (C2C) program. To increase positive outcomes for vulnerable New Yorkers in their communities and identify effective new strategies for addressing the mental health at the community level, the Mayorâ€™s Fund to Advance NYC, the Mayorâ€™s Office for Economic Opportunity (NYC Opportunity), and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) developed Connections to Care (C2C). This five-year, $30M initiative tests a model of partnerships between 15 community-based organizations (CBOs) paired with a licensed mental health provider (MHPs). Through this partnership, CBO staff receive ongoing training and coaching in a core set of mental health skills (Screening, Mental Health First Aid, Psychoeducation and Motivational Interviewing) that are incorporated into daily programming at the CBO. These skills are used to promote the well-being and mental health of program participants and refer those in need of more in-depth clinical care to services at the MHP.  The core C2C mental health skills and model have preliminary evidence of impact from prior studies in the field.  Through C2C, DOHMH and its partners seek to advance the level of evidence through a quasi-experimental third party evaluation.      The Senior Advisor oversees all aspects of the testing of C2C model.  This involves ensuring high-quality implementation of the model, managing data collection from the CBOs (also referred to as vendors or contractors), providing strategic leadership for an overall technical assistance and learning network strategy, and ensuring data from implementation informs decision making and contributes to our understanding of the model as part of a 3-year evaluation of the model.

This includes supporting learning and program improvement, and leveraging research and learning from sites.   -Package and disseminate findings through conferences, webinars, and trainings for internal and external audiences.   â€“Liaise with stakeholders including Mayorâ€™s Fund, NYC Opportunity, and CBOs on issues of implementation, evaluation, continuous quality improvement, and sustainability.  â€“Coordinate with external evaluation partners to support data collection efforts and contribute to technical articles and publications.  â€“Additional DOHMH-related duties as necessary.\t\"1.
