Background  NYCHAâ€™s mission is to increase opportunities for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers by providing safe, affordable housing and facilitating access to social and community services.  Almost 400,000 New Yorkers reside in NYCHAâ€™s 325 public housing developments around the five boroughs, and another 235,000 receive subsidized rental assistance in private homes through the NYCHA-administered Section 8 Leased Housing Program.  In 2016 NYCHA released the NextGeneration NYCHA Sustainability Agenda, the Authorityâ€™s 10-year plan to improve energy efficiency and shrink NYCHAâ€™s carbon footprint, and create healthy and comfortable homes that will withstand the challenge of climate change.  For more information, visit j.mp/green-nycha.   NYCHAâ€™s work on clean and renewable energy is anchored by its commitment to site 25MW of renewables at NYCHA by 2026, a part of the HUD Renew300 program (https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/renewable-energy/).  NYCHA began implementation toward this goal by releasing the first large-scale solar RFP in 2017 with a goal of securing third-party solar development for up to 6MW, to be implemented as community shared solar projects (http://www1.nyc.gov/site/nycha/about/press/pr-2017/solar-20171013.page).  NYCHA is also developing a parallel program targeting small-building solar to encourage direct involvement of small businesses and non-profits from NYCHA communities.  NYCHA seeks a Program Manager with a passion for sustainability to lead NYCHAâ€™s portfolio of clean, renewable, and distributed energy initiatives.  Reporting to the Director for Sustainability Programs, the Program Manager will oversee NYCHAâ€™s progress toward meeting its commitment to site 25MW of renewable energy capacity at NYCHA developments, and serve as the in-house point person on clean energy policy ranging from VDER to clean fleets.
